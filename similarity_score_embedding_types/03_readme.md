# NLP Vectorization & FAQ Matching Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates core **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, starting from traditional text vectorization to modern LLM-based sentence embeddings, and applies them to a real-life **FAQ Question Matching System**.


---

## Techniques Implemented

### Text Vectorization
- One-Hot Encoding (OHE)
- Bag of Words (BoW)
- N-grams
- TF-IDF

### Word Embeddings
- Word2Vec 

### LLM-Based Embeddings
- SentenceTransformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Context-aware sentence embeddings
- Cosine similarity for semantic comparison

## Mini Project: FAQ Question Matching System
A semantic matching system that maps user queries to the most relevant FAQ using sentence embeddings and cosine similarity.

**Use Case:** Customer support automation, semantic search.
