# Deep Learning Practice 

## Introduction  

**Deep Learning** is a branch of **Machine Learning** that uses multi-layered neural networks to learn complex patterns from data.  
It has transformed fields like **computer vision, NLP, speech recognition**, and **reinforcement learning**, enabling machines to achieve human-level performance.  

Unlike traditional ML, deep learning models automatically extract features from raw data (images, text, audio) and are trained on large datasets using **gradient descent**.  

### Key Concepts  

- **Neural Networks (ANNs):** Core building blocks  
- **Activation Functions:** Introduce non-linearity  
- **Backpropagation:** Weight optimization algorithm  
- **CNNs:** For image and spatial data  
- **RNNs / LSTMs:** For sequential data (text, time series)  
- **Transformers:** Modern architectures powering GPT, BERT, etc.
